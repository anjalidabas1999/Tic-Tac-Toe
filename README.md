# Tic-Tac-Toe
It is also known as Noughts and crosses!! and is popular as the game of Xs and Os.
Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
Players soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw. Hence, tic-tac-toe is most often played by young children, who often have not yet discovered the optimal strategy.
Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees.
